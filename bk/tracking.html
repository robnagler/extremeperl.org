<p>
XP&#39;s focus is on the here and now.  The team knows how it is doing by
eliciting feedback through testing and frequent releases.  Sometimes
this feedback is not enough to keep a project on track.  Everybody
strays from the path now and then, and runs the risk of getting caught
in a web made by a big, hairy spider.  That&#39;s why every XP project
needs a tracker.
</p>

<p>
Tracking in XP let&#39;s us know if we&#39;ve strayed off the path.  Tracking
introduces feedback about how we are doing with respect to
iteration and release plans.  The tracker is the team member who is
responsible for asking the team how far along they are with their
tasks for the iteration.  If the iteration is behind schedule, the
tracker asks the customer to drop tasks.  Intra-release feedback is
generated by tracking the velocity trend.  When the velocity curve is
unstable, it&#39;s a sign of trouble.
</p>

<p>
The role of tracker is typicially filled by a manager, but can be
anybody who communicates well with the rest of the team.  The
tracker&#39;s job is to help find root causes as well as gather data about
the project&#39;s status.  To be effective, the tracker must be a
perceptive listener to hear the subtle clues that lead to root causes.
</p>

<p>
This chapter explains how tracking works, what&#39;s tracked, ways to keep
everybody informed, and most importantly, how to get back on track
if you&#39;re lost battling big, hairy spiders.
</p>




<h3>Iteration Tracking</h3>

<p>
Iteration tracking is a polling activity.  The tracker asks team members how
their work is going once or twice a week.  These meetings are between
the tracker and one team member at a time.  This keeps everyone at
ease, and allows the tracker to ask personal questions if need be.
</p>

<p>
To simplify tracking, try to limit task length to one ideal day.
With multi-day tasks, the tracker needs to ask how much time is left to
get a precise reading of the project&#39;s status.  With
single day tasks, the tracker need only ask whether the task is completed or
not.  This latter precision is enough to provide an accurate picture of
the iteration&#39;s progress.
</p>

<p>
Iteration tracking is not micro-management.  The tracker doesn&#39;t try
to control how people do things.  The purpose of
tracking is to find out what is happening using a
simple, objective measure, such as, what tasks are done and what are
their estimates.  If the tracker has to ask how close a task is to
being done, the measure is less objective, and the tracker may have to
be more intrusive into how the team member came up with the estimate.
The simple binary test ("is it done?") avoids this extra level of
detail, and keeps the meetings shorter and more straightforward.
</p>

<p>
After the tracking meetings, the tracker sums the estimates of
completed tasks, divides the sum by the current velocity, and
multiplies by 100.  The result is the percentage of planned work which
has been completed for this iteration.  If the
number is 60% and you are at the end of day three of a one week
iteration, the iteration is on track.  If the number is lower,
the tracker needs to ask the customer to cut scope.
</p>




<h3>Don&#39;t Slip the Date</h3>

<p>
Traditional project management tends towards adjusting the schedule to
meet reality, that is, scope is fixed, and it&#39;s the date that needs to
slip.  XP&#39;s view is that scope is variable, and it&#39;s more important to
keep dates fixed.
</p>

<p>
If you change the date, the entire team has to be involved.
The team members who are on track will need new tasks (more
communication).  Their flow will be disrupted by an extra meeting
to figure out what tasks need to be added.
</p>

<p>
The cheaper alternative to slipping the date is to cut tasks.  This is
less costly in terms of communication.  The tracker already knows
which tasks are in trouble, and he is already are talking with the
people who are responsible for them.  The tracker&#39;s job is to make the
customer aware of the problems.  The programmers who are on track
needn&#39;t be bothered.
</p>

<p>
The customer picks which stories to drop.  The tracker gives the
customer the raw data (list of problematic stories) as well as your
own interpretation of the factors involved.  Call in the programmers
to help you explain the details if need be.  The better informed the
customer is, the more easily she can decide what to drop.
</p>



<h3>Adding Tasks</h3>

<p>
Believe it or not, there are times when stories need to be added to an
iteration.  For example, the customer may see an important problem
while using the prior iteration or a programmer may have finished all
his tasks before the end of the iteration.
</p>

<p>
The customer decides what to add.
The tracker only involves those programmers who are available for the
additional stories.
Not that the cusomter must stay within budget, so
tasks may need to be dropped to balance out the additions.
The tracker gives the customer a list of tasks in progress to help
prevent unnecessary task switching.
</p>



<h3>The Tracker</h3>

<p>
The tracker must be someone who can speak directly to all team
members.  He needs to be a perceptive listener, because
tracking is more than just numbers.  It&#39;s about finding root causes
and resolving them.  Most problems you run into are related to the
people, not the technology.  And, people are needed to solve them.
</p>

<p>
The role of tracker is best played by the project manager, in my
opinion.   Alternatively, you may want to rotate the position of
Tracker throughout your project, or rotate the trackers between
projects.  Tracking, like management in general, needs to be
understood by the whole team.<a href="tracking.html#2">[2]</a>
Rotating everybody through the position of tracker, gives the entire
team the opporunity to see the forest for the trees.
</p>


<a name="release-tracking"></a>
<h3>Release Tracking</h3>

<p>
The simplest way to track release progress is with a graph of
velocity.  The graph should quickly converge on a constant value, for
example: 
</p>


<center><b>Typical Velocity Graph</b></center>
<div align="center"><img border="0" src="../i/typical-velocity.png"></div>


<p>
Velocity converges when the task estimates align with actual
capacity.  Once this happens, velocity should remain relatively
constant.
</p>

<p>
Now let&#39;s take a look at a graph from a troubled project:<a href="tracking.html#3">[3]</a>
</p>


<center><b>Troubled Project&#39;s Velocity Graph</b></center>
<div align="center"><img border="0" src="../i/problematic-velocity.png"></div>


<p>
The project started out normally with velocity starting to converge
around the third and fourth iteration.  By the fifth or sixth
iteration velocity started to drop off.  The project was in serious
trouble by the ninth iteration.  The next step is figuring out why.
</p>




<h3>What Goes Wrong?</h3>

<p>
Finding the root cause for a velocity trend change can be difficult.
In this project, we had a problem with quality which was indicated by
an increase in the number of stories to fix defects.  This was obvious
when reviewing the story cards.  When I went back to review the cards
for this chapter, it struck me that the task estimates seem shorter as
the project progressed.  While I don&#39;t recommend tracking average task
length in general, the graph illuminates the problem in this case:
</p>


<center><b>Troubled Project&#39;s Average Task Length Graph</b></center>
<div align="center"><img border="0" src="../i/problematic-task-size.png"></div>


<p>
The graph shows that the average task length started dropping around
the fourth iteration.  In conjunction with the drop in velocity, this
indicates the tasks were shorter, and we were underestimating them.
These symptoms are indicative that change was harder, and were probably
caused by quality issues.  The team was battling the big,
hairy, low quality spider. 
</p>

<p>
Low quality is not a root cause, rather it&#39;s a symptom of not using
best practices.  After reviewing the project, we attributed the poor
quality to the following root causes:
</p>

<dl>


<dt>Customer Unavailable</dt>
<dd><p>
The customer didn&#39;t
start using the system until the fifth iteration.
</p></dd>



<dt>Too Few Acceptance Tests</dt>
<dd><p>
The team didn&#39;t test end to end function.  It was thought there
wasn&#39;t enough time, and was partially related to the team&#39;s relative
inexperience.
</p></dd>



<dt>Inexperience</dt>
<dd><p>
The domain, development environment, Perl, and XP were all new to the
developers.  The customer was new to XP.  Doing too many new things at
once is rarely a good idea, and in this case, was a significant weak
point.
</p></dd>


</dl>

<p>
In the next section, you&#39;ll see how we fixed these problems.  For now,
let&#39;s take a look at a few other problems you might encounter when
developing with XP:
</p>

<dl>


<dt>Failing to Finish</dt>
<dd><p>
The customer does not stop making changes, and won&#39;t launch until all
changes are done.  This is a planning failure.  With XP, you
need to pick dates, and stick to them.  The tracker should noticed
that dates are slipping.  In XP, we don&#39;t slip dates, we cut scope instead.
</p></dd>



<dt>Too Little Refactoring</dt>
<dd><p>
Refactoring is put off until after launch.  This reduces
quality, which can be difficult to recover from, because the team
falls into the bug-fixing trap soon after launch.  Too little
refactoring multiplies defects through copy-and-paste-itis: an
inflammation of defects caused by over use of the copy-and-paste
function in editors.  The tracker should notice that the code base is
growing too rapidly.   If the number of lines of code is growing
linearly with the number of ideal days, it means there&#39;s not enough
refactoring.  It&#39;s unlikely that every programmer thinks up the
right code abstraction for every task.  The programmers
have to refactor to create the right abstractions, and that will
shrink the code base.
</p></dd>



<dt>Too Much Refactoring</dt>
<dd><p>
The programmers are perfectionists, and they won&#39;t stop trying to
improve the code.  This greatly reduces the amount of business value
being added, and pushes off the launch date.  This one may be a bit
tricky to notice with a simple velocity graph, because the velocity
may be constant.  This is where the tracker needs to use his sixth
sense that velocity is simply too low.
</p></dd>



<dt>Not Enough Unit Tests</dt>
<dd><p>
Finding the right balance on unit tests is not easy, but it&#39;s fairly
clear when there aren&#39;t enough: the team is afraid to make changes.
This happened on one of my first XP-like (or should I say, XP-lite)
projects.  The project was successful enough, but now we are living
under the constant fear of change.  We&#39;re adding unit tests slowly,
but it takes time, and it&#39;s hard to justify writing tests when
"everything is working fine".
</p></dd>



<dt>Too Little Pair Programming</dt>
<dd><p>
The programmers go off into their corners to get work done.  The
problem is that they don&#39;t know what everybody else is doing, and
there&#39;s probably a lot of duplicated effort.  Solitary programming is
visually obvious to the tracker.  It may even be mandated by
management to save money.  Velocity may be constant.  However, quality
will soon suffer.
</p></dd>


</dl>




<h3>Fixing Troubled Projects</h3>

<p>
All of these problems can be resolved.  Sometimes the solutions take
courage, such as, writing unit tests for a large testless codebase or
telling the customer to launch now instead of waiting for one more
change.  The hardest part, I find, is figuring out what is wrong in
the first place.  The solution in most cases is simple: stop the
counter-productive behavior.
</p>

<p>
Let&#39;s return to our troubled project.  The customer realized there was
a problem.  We (the management) realized what was wrong, and the
solutions were obvious.  We cut scope so we could focus on improving
quality.  We substituted a senior developer into the project.  We
added some acceptance tests.  And, probably most importantly, we made
sure the customer was using the system.  After four week-long
iterations, we launched the system.  We encountered a few structural
issues after launch, but the project was on track, and the customer
was much happier.
</p>

<p>
Probably one of the hardest problems to fix is when there has been too
little refactoring. Extreme Perl has a size advantage in this case.  Part
of the reason we were able to fix our troubled project so quickly is
that there was very little code to fix.  Just a few thousand lines is
all we needed to solve a fairly complicated problem in Perl.
</p>

<p>
If you are facing a mountain of code written in a relatively short
time frame, it&#39;s likely to be bad code.  Unfortunately, a mountain of
code is often associated with a dearth of tests.  You may end up
having to throw all the code away, but the first step is to write
tests to be sure you have documented the expected behavior.  Once you
have tests, start whittling the mountain away.  The tests will make
sure you don&#39;t break anything, and whittling will turn any code
mountain into a codehill--pardon my metaphoritis.

<h3>Meetings</h3>

<p>
XP puts people over processes.  We don&#39;t like wasting time in group
meetings.  Formal meetings are limited to planning and what we
 call, <i>stand-up meetings</i>.
</p>

<p>
A stand-up meeting occurs daily, usually in the morning.  The meetings
are held standing up, hence the name.  Standing helps limit the
meeting&#39;s duration.  The content of a stand-up is announcements and a
brief status report from all team members.
</p>

<p>
As an alternative to stand-ups, you might consider status meetings
held over lunch once or twice a week.  Lunch is a more relaxed way
than a stand-up to make announcements and discuss what you are working
on.  The status lunch also gives the team a chance to socialize.  
</p>

<p>
The company should pay for the meal.  At one company we hired an
Italian cook to prepare family-style meals three times a week.
Nobody was late to lunch when Dina was cooking!
</p>

<h3>Show Your Stuff</h3>

<p>
Up till now, being the tracker may not seem like a lot of fun.
However, part of the tracker&#39;s job is encouraging people to celebrate
their successes as well as helping out with failures.  Everybody wants
to be praised for their work.  The tracker should encourage people to
show off their completed work to the entire team.  Success is
contagious.  When you see the excitement from a sweet demo, you&#39;ll be
motivated to work that much harder so you can demo your cool stuff.
</p>

<p>
Demonstrations are great way to maintain team spirit and momentum.
Even a short e-mail explaining your result is enough.  For example,
you introduce a cache and improve the performance by 10 times.  Send
out a graph containing the performance test comparison.
</p>

<p>
The tracker should organize demonstrations if they don&#39;t come about
naturally.  Sometimes team members are reticent to show their work.
Weekly demonstrations are a good way to ensure everybody is praised
for their accomplishments.  Before or after lunch are good times for
demos (see sidebar).
</p>




<h3>Sign Off</h3>

<p>
The main indicator for how much business value has been implemented is
the percentage of acceptance tests that are passing.  Acceptance
testing is the way we validate stories have been implemented.  While
this is a great way to measure where you are, it&#39;s also nice to audit
the cards themselves.  I like my customers to formally sign off
acceptance on the story cards in an acceptance meeting.  The formality
helps ensure the customer, the tracker, and the cards are in sync.
In large projects, there&#39;s bound to be a
problem with or a feature missing from one of the stories.  The
customer and the tracker should read the story cards again to make
sure they really are complete.
</p>




<h3>Here and Now</h3>

<p>
Rather than trying to predict the future, XP focuses on the present
with an eye on the past.
We know where we are and from whence we have come.  The unit tests tell the
programmer if his changes are valid.  The acceptance tests validate
the system as a whole.  The tracker knows which tasks are done and
which are not.  These feedback mechanisms keep everybody informed
about the project&#39;s state.
</p>

<p>
It&#39;s normal to have unfinished tasks at the end of an iteration.
Don&#39;t worry.  You&#39;ll complete them next iteration.  No amount of
charting, analysis, and/or forecasting will magically complete the
tasks for you.  If there is a pervasive planning problem, it&#39;s almost
always related to the people on the project, not some technological
issue.  XP&#39;s practices are designed to prevent people issues from
remaining hidden.  The tracker&#39;s main job is to remind people what
those best practices are.
