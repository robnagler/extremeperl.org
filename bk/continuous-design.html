<blockquote>

<p>
In the beginning was simplicity.
</p>
<div align="right">-- Richard Dawkins<a href="continuous-design.html#1">[1]</a></div></blockquote>

<p>
Software evolves. All systems are adapted to the needs of their users
and the circumstances in which they operate, even after years of
planning.<a href="continuous-design.html#2">[2]</a> 
Some people call this maintenance programming, implementing change
requests, or, simply, firefighting.  In XP, it&#39;s called <i>continuous
design</i>, and it&#39;s the only way we design and build systems.
Whatever you call it, change happens, and it involves two activities:
changing what the code does and improving its internal structure.
</p>

<p>
In XP, these two activities have names: implementing stories and
refactoring.  <i>Refactoring</i> is the process of
making code better without changing its external behavior. The art of
refactoring is a fundamental skill in programming.  It&#39;s an important
part of the programmer&#39;s craft to initiate refactorings to accommodate
changes requested by the customer. In XP, we use
tests to be sure the behavior hasn&#39;t changed.  
</p>

<p>
As any implementation grows, it needs to be refactored as changes (new
features or defect fixes) are introduced. Sometimes we refactor before
implementing a story, for example, to expose an existing algorithm as
its own API.  Other times, we refactor after adding a new feature,
because we only see how to eliminate unnecessary duplication, after
the feature is implemented.  This to and fro of code expansion
(implementing stories) and contraction (refactoring) is how the design
evolves continuously.  And, by the way, this is how Perl was designed:
on demand and continuously.  It&#39;s one of the reasons Perl continues to
grow and thrive while other languages whither and die.
</p>

<p>
This chapter evolves the design we started in
<a href="test-driven-design.html">Test-Driven Design</a>.  We introduce refactoring
by simplifying the EMA equation.  We add a new class (simple moving
average) to satisfy a new story, and then we refactor the two classes
to share a common base class.  Finally, we fix a defect by exposing an
API in both classes, and then we refactor the APIs into a single API
in the base class.
</p>




<h3>Refactoring</h3>

<p>
The first step in continous design is to be sure you have a test.  You
need a test to add a story, and you use existing tests to be sure you
don&#39;t break anything with a refactoring.  This chapter picks up where
<a href="test-driven-design.html">Test-Driven Design</a> left off.  We have a working
exponentional moving average (EMA) module with a working unit test.
</p>

<p>
The first improvement is a simple refactoring.  The equation in
<tt>compute</tt> is more complex than it needs to be:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
sub compute {
    my($self, $value) = @_;
    return $self-&gt;{avg} = defined($self-&gt;{avg})
        ? $value * $self-&gt;{alpha} + $self-&gt;{avg} * (1 - $self-&gt;{alpha})
        : $value;
}

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The refactored equation yields the same results and is simpler:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
sub compute {
    my($self, $value) = @_;
    return $self-&gt;{avg} <b>+=</b> defined($self-&gt;{avg})
        ? <b>$self-&gt;{alpha} * ($value - $self-&gt;{avg})</b>
        : $value;
}

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
After the refactoring, we run our test, and it passes.  That&#39;s all
there is to refactoring.  Change the code, run the test for the
module(s) we are modifying, run the entire unit test suite, and then
check in once all tests pass.  Well, it&#39;s not always that easy,
sometimes we make mistakes.  That&#39;s what the tests are for, and tests
are what simplifies refactoring.
</p>




<h3>Simple Moving Average</h3>

<p>
Our hypothetical customer would like to expand her website to compete
with Yahoo! Finance.  The following graph shows that Yahoo! offers two
moving averages:
</p>

<a name="yahoo-rhat"></a>
<center><b>Yahoo! 20 day moving averages on 3 month graph from May 18, 2004<a href="continuous-design.html#3">[3]</a></b></center>
<div align="center"><img border="0" src="../i/yahoo-rhat-ma20.png"></div>


<p>
In order to provide the equivalent functionality, we need to implement
a simple moving average (SMA or MA in Yahoo!&#39;s graph).  An SMA is the
arithmetic mean of the last N periods of the price series.  For a
daily graph, we add in the new day&#39;s price and we remove the oldest
price from the sum before we take the average.
</p>




<h3>SMA Unit Test</h3>

<p>
The following test demonstrates the algorithm.  The test was created
by starting with a copy of the EMA test from the
<a href="test-driven-design.html">Test-Driven Design</a> chapter.  We replaced EMA with
SMA, and changed the values to match the SMA algorithm:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
use strict;
use Test::More tests =&gt; 11;
use Test::Exception;
BEGIN {
    use_ok(&#39;SMA&#39;);
}
ok(my $sma = SMA-&gt;new(4));
is($sma-&gt;compute(5), 5);
is($sma-&gt;compute(5), 5);
is($sma-&gt;compute(11), 7);
is($sma-&gt;compute(11), 8);
is($sma-&gt;compute(13), 10);
dies_ok {SMA-&gt;new(-2)};
dies_ok {SMA-&gt;new(0)};
lives_ok {SMA-&gt;new(1)};
dies_ok {SMA-&gt;new(2.5)};

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Like the EMA, the SMA stays constant (5) when the input values remain
constant (5).  The deviance cases are identical, which gives us
another clue that the two algorithms have a lot in common.  The
difference is that average value changes differently, and we need to
test the boundary condition when values "fall off the
end" of the average.
</p>




<h3>SMA Implementation</h3>

<p>
The EMA and the SMA unit test are almost identical.  It follows that
the implementations should be nearly identical.  Some people might
want to create a base class so that <i>SMA</i> and
<tt>EMA</tt> could share the common code.  However, at
this stage, we don&#39;t know what that code might be.  That&#39;s why we do
the simplest thing that could possibly work, and copy the
<tt>EMA</tt> class to the <tt>SMA</tt>
class.  And, let&#39;s run the test to see what happens after we change
the package name from <tt>EMA</tt> to
<tt>SMA</tt>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
1..11
ok 1 - use SMA;
ok 2
ok 3
ok 4
not ok 5
#     Failed test (SMA.t at line 10)
#          got: &#39;7.4&#39;
#     expected: &#39;7&#39;
not ok 6
#     Failed test (SMA.t at line 11)
#          got: &#39;8.84&#39;
#     expected: &#39;8&#39;
not ok 7
#     Failed test (SMA.t at line 12)
#          got: &#39;10.504&#39;
#     expected: &#39;10&#39;
ok 8
ok 9
ok 10
ok 11
# Looks like you failed 3 tests of 11.

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The test fails, because an EMA algorithm in an SMA&#39;s clothing is still
an EMA.  That&#39;s good.  Otherwise, this section would be way too
short.  Without further ado, here&#39;s the correct algorithm:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
package SMA;
use strict;

sub new {
    my($proto, $length) = @_;
    die(&quot;$length: length must be a positive 32-bit integer&quot;)
        unless $length =~ /^\d+$/ &amp;&amp; $length &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; $length &lt;= 0x7fff_ffff;
    return bless({
        length =&gt; $length,
        values =&gt; [],
    }, ref($proto) || $proto);
}

sub compute {
    my($self, $value) = @_;
    $self-&gt;{sum} -= shift(@{$self-&gt;{values}})
        if $self-&gt;{length} eq @{$self-&gt;{values}};
    return ($self-&gt;{sum} += $value) / push(@{$self-&gt;{values}}, $value);
}

1;

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The <tt>sum</tt> calculation is different, but the basic
structure is the same.  The <tt>new</tt> method checks to
makes sure that <tt>length</tt> is reasonable.  We need to
maintain a queue of all values in the sum, because an SMA is a FIFO
algorithm.  When a value is more than <tt>length</tt>
periods old, it has absolutely no affect on the average. As an aside,
the SMA algorithm pays a price for that exactness, because it must
retain <tt>length</tt> values where EMA requires only
one. That&#39;s the main reason why EMAs are more popular than SMAs in
financial engineering applications.
</p>

<p>
For our application, what we care about is that this implementation of
SMA satisfies the unit test.  We also note that EMA and SMA have a lot
in common.  However, after satisfying the SMA test, we run all
the unit tests to be sure we didn&#39;t inadvertently modify another file,
and then we checkin to be sure we have a working baseline.  Frequent
checkins is important when designing continuously.  Programmers have
to be free to make changes knowing that the source repository always
holds a recent, correct implementation.
</p>




<h3>Move Common Features to a Base Class</h3>

<p>
The SMA implementation is functionally correct, but it isn&#39;t a good
design.  The quick copy-and-paste job was necessary to start the
implementation, and now we need to go back and improve the design
through a little refactoring.  The classes <tt>SMA</tt>
and <tt>EMA</tt> can and should share code.
We want to represent each concept once and only once so we only have
to fix defects in the implementation of the concepts once and only once.
</p>

<p>
The repetitive code is contained almost entirely in
the <tt>new</tt> methods of <tt>SMA</tt> and
<tt>EMA</tt>.  The obvious solution is to create a base
class from which <tt>SMA</tt> and <tt>EMA</tt>
are derived.  This is a very common refactoring, and it&#39;s one you&#39;ll
use over and over again.
</p>

<p>
Since this is a refactoring, we don&#39;t write a new test.  The
refactoring must not change the observable behavior.  The existing
unit tests validate that the behavior hasn&#39;t changed.  That&#39;s
what differentiates a refactoring from simply changing the
code.  Refactoring is the discipline of making changes to improve the
design of existing code without changing the external behavior of that
code.
</p>

<p>
The simple change we are making now is moving the common parts of
<tt>new</tt> into a base class called
<tt>MABase</tt>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
package MABase;
use strict;

sub new {
    my($proto, $length, $fields) = @_;
    die(&quot;$length: length must be a positive 32-bit integer&quot;)
        unless $length =~ /^\d+$/ &amp;&amp; $length &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; $length &lt;= 0x7fff_ffff;
    return bless($fields, ref($proto) || $proto);
}

1;

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The corresponding change to <tt>SMA</tt> is:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
use base &#39;MABase&#39;;
sub new {
    my($proto, $length) = @_;
    return $proto-&gt;SUPER::new($length, {
        length =&gt; $length,
        values =&gt; [],
    });
}

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
For brevity, I left out the the <tt>EMA</tt> changes,
which are similar to these.  Note that <tt>MABase</tt>
doesn&#39;t share fields between its two subclasses.  The only common code
is checking the length and blessing the instance is shared.
</p>





<h3>Refactor the Unit Tests</h3>

<p>
After we move the common code into the base clase, we run all the
existing tests to be sure we didn&#39;t break anything.  However, we
aren&#39;t done.  We have a new class, which deserves its own unit test.
<tt>EMA.t</tt> and <tt>SMA.t</tt> have four
cases in common.  That&#39;s unnecessary duplication, and here&#39;s
<tt>MABase.t</tt> with the cases factored out:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
use strict;
use Test::More tests =&gt; 5;
use Test::Exception;
BEGIN {
    use_ok(&#39;MABase&#39;);
}
dies_ok {MABase-&gt;new(-2, {})};
dies_ok {MABase-&gt;new(0, {})};
lives_ok {MABase-&gt;new(1, {})};
dies_ok {MABase-&gt;new(2.5, {})};

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
After running the new test, we refactor <tt>EMA.t</tt>
(and similarly <tt>SMA.t</tt>) as follows:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
use strict;
use Test::More tests =&gt; 5;
BEGIN {
    use_ok(&#39;EMA&#39;);
}
ok(my $ema = EMA-&gt;new(4));
is($ema-&gt;compute(5), 5);
is($ema-&gt;compute(5), 5);
is($ema-&gt;compute(10), 7);

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
By removing the redundancy, we make the classes and their tests
cohesive.  <tt>MABase</tt> and its test is concerned
with validating <tt>$length</tt>.
<tt>EMA</tt> and <tt>SMA</tt> are
responsible for computing moving averages.  This conceptual clarity,
also known as <i>cohesion</i>, is
what we strive for.
</p>




<h3>Fixing a Defect</h3>

<p>
The design is better, but it&#39;s wrong.  The customer noticed the
difference between the Yahoo! graph and the one produced by the
algorithms above:
</p>


<center><b>Incorrect moving average graph</b></center>
<div align="center"><img border="0" src="../i/rhat-without-build-up.png"></div>


<p>
The lines on this graph start from the same point.  On the Yahoo!
graph in the <a href="continuous-design.html#yahoo-rhat">Yahoo! 20 day moving averages on 3 month graph from May 18, 2004<footnote><para>
<systemitem role="url">http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ta?s=RHAT&amp;t=3m&amp;p=e20,m20</systemitem>
</para></footnote></a>, you see that the moving
averages don&#39;t start at the same value as the price.  The problem is
that a 20 day moving average with one data point is not valid, because
the single data point is weighted incorrectly.  The results are skewed
towards the initial prices.
</p>

<p>
The solution to the problem is to "build up" the moving
average data before the initial display point.  The build up period
varies with the type of moving average.  For an SMA, the build up
length is the same as the length of the average minus one, that is,
the average is correctly weighted on the "length" price.
For an EMA, the build up length is usually twice the length, because
the influence of a price doesn&#39;t simply disappear from the average
after length days.  Rather the price&#39;s influence decays over time.
</p>

<p>
The general concept is essentially the same for both averages.  The
algorithms themselves aren&#39;t different.  The build up period simply
means that we don&#39;t want to display the prices.
</p>

separate out compute and value.  Compute returns undef.  value blows
up.  is_ok or will_compute_ok?  The two calls are inefficent, but the
design is simpler.  Show the gnuplot code to generate the graph.
gnuplot reads from stdin?

<p>
The only difference
is that the two algorithms have different build up lengths.  The
easiest solution is therefore to add a field in the sub-classes which
the base classes exposes via a method called
<tt>build_up_length</tt>.   We need to expand our tests
first:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
use strict;
use Test::More tests =&gt; 6;
BEGIN {
    use_ok(&#39;EMA&#39;);
}
ok(my $ema = EMA-&gt;new(4));<b>
is($ema-&gt;build_up_length, 8);</b>
is($ema-&gt;compute(5), 5);
is($ema-&gt;compute(5), 5);
is($ema-&gt;compute(10), 7);

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The correct answer for <tt>EMA</tt> is always two times
<tt>length</tt>.  It&#39;s simple enough that we only need one
case to test it.   The change to <tt>SMA.t</tt> is
similar.
</p>

<p>
To satisfy these tests, we add <tt>build_up_length</tt> to
<tt>MABase</tt>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
sub build_up_length {
    return shift-&gt;{build_up_length};
}

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The computation of the value of <tt>build_up_length</tt>
requires a change to <tt>new</tt> in EMA:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
sub new {
    my($proto, $length) = @_;
    return $proto-&gt;SUPER::new($length, {
        alpha =&gt; 2 / ($length + 1),<b>
        build_up_length =&gt; $length * 2,</b>
    });
}

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The change to SMA is similar, and left out for brevity.  After we fix
the plotting code to reference <tt>build_up_length</tt>,
we end up with the following graph:
</p>


<center><b>Moving average graph with correction for build up period</b></center>
<div align="center"><img border="0" src="../i/rhat-with-build-up.png"></div>





<h3>Global Refactoring</h3>

<p>
After releasing the build up fix, our customer is happy again.  We
also have some breathing room to fix up the design again.  When we
added <tt>build_up_length</tt>, we exposed a configuration
value via the moving average object.  The plotting module also needs
the value of <tt>length</tt> to print the labels
("20-day EMA" and "20-day SMA") on the
graph.  This configuration value is passed to the moving average
object, but isn&#39;t exposed via the <tt>MABase</tt> API.
That&#39;s bad, because <tt>length</tt> and
<tt>build_up_length</tt> are related configuration
values.  The plotting module needs both values.
</p>

<p>
To test this feature, we add a test to <tt>SMA.t</tt>
(and similarly, to <tt>EMA.t</tt>):
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
use strict;
use Test::More tests =&gt; 8;
BEGIN {
    use_ok(&#39;SMA&#39;);
}
ok(my $sma = SMA-&gt;new(4));
is($sma-&gt;build_up_length, 3);<b>
is($sma-&gt;length, 4);</b>
is($sma-&gt;compute(5), 5);
is($sma-&gt;compute(5), 5);
is($sma-&gt;compute(11), 7);
is($sma-&gt;compute(11), 8);

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
We run the test to see that indeed <tt>length</tt>
does not exist in <tt>MABase</tt> or its subclasses.  
Then we add <tt>length</tt> to
<tt>MABase</tt>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
sub length {
    return shift-&gt;{length};
}

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<tt>SMA</tt> already has a field called
<tt>length</tt> so we only need to change
<tt>EMA</tt> to store the <tt>length</tt>:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
sub new {
    my($proto, $length) = @_;
    return $proto-&gt;SUPER::new($length, {
        alpha =&gt; 2 / ($length + 1),
        build_up_length =&gt; $length * 2,<b>
        length =&gt; $length,</b>
    });
}

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This modification is a refactoring even though external behavior (the
API) is different.  When an API and all its clients (importers)
change, it&#39;s called a <i>global refactoring</i>.  In
this case, the global refactoring is backwards compatible, because we
are adding new behavior.  The clients were using a copy of
<tt>length</tt> implicitly.
Adding an explicit <tt>length</tt> method
to the API change won&#39;t break that behavior. However, this type of
global refactoring can cause problems down the road, because
old implicit uses of <tt>length</tt> still will work until
the behavior of the <tt>length</tt> method changes.  At
which point, we&#39;ve got to know that the implicit coupling is no longer
valid.
</p>

<p>
That&#39;s why tests are so important with continuous design.   Global
refactorings are easy when each module has its own unit test and the
application has an acceptance test suite.  The tests will more than
likely catch the case where implicit couplings go wrong either at the
time of the refactoring or some time later.  Without
tests, global refactorings are scary, and most programmers don&#39;t
attempt them.  When an implicit coupling like this becomes cast in
stone, the code base is a bit more fragile, and continous design is a
bit harder.  Without some type of remediation, the policy is
"don&#39;t change anything", and we head down the slippery
slope that some people call <i>Software
Entropy</i>.<a href="continuous-design.html#4">[4]</a>
</p>


<table width="95%" border="1" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><tr><td>
<h3>Continuous Rennovation in the Real World</h3>

<p>
Programmers often use building buildings as a metaphor for creating
software.  It&#39;s often the wrong model, because it&#39;s not easy to
copy-and-paste.  The physical world doesn&#39;t allow easy replication
beyond the gene level.  However, continuous design is more commonplace
than many people might think.  My company had our office rennovated
before we moved in.  Here is a view of the kitchen (and David Farber)
before the upgrade:
</p>


<center><b>Before rennovation</b></center>
<div align="center"><img border="0" src="../i/before-rennovation.png"></div>


<p>
After the rennovation, the kitchen looked like this:
</p>


<center><b>After rennovation</b></center>
<div align="center"><img border="0" src="../i/after-rennovation.png"></div>


<p>
If a couple of general contractors can restructure an office in a few
weeks, imagine what you can do with your software in
the same time.  The architectural plans did change continuously during
the implementation.  The general contractors considered this
completely normal.  After all, it&#39;s impossible for the customer to get
a good idea what the office will look like until the walls start going
up.
</p>

</td></tr></table>



<h3>Simplify Accessors</h3>

<p>
Software entropy creeps in when the software fails to adapt to
a change.  For example, we now have two accessors that are almost
identical:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
sub length {
    return shift-&gt;{length};
}

sub build_up_length {
    return shift-&gt;{build_up_length};
}

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The code is repeated.  That&#39;s not a big problem in the specific, because
we&#39;ve only done it twice.  This subtle creep gets to be a bigger
problem when someone else copies what we&#39;ve done here.  Simple
copy-and-paste is probably the single biggest cause of software rot in
any system.  New programmers on the project think that&#39;s how "we
do things here", and we&#39;ve got a standard practice for
copying a single error all over the code.  It&#39;s not that this
particular code is wrong; it&#39;s that the practice is wrong.  This is
why it&#39;s important to stamp out the practice when you can, and in this
case it&#39;s very easy to do.
</p>

<p>
We can replace both accessors with a single new API called
<tt>get</tt>.  This global refactoring is very easy,
because we are removing an existing API.  That&#39;s another reason to
make couplings explicit: when the API changes, all uses fail with
method not found.  The two unit test cases for EMA now become:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
is($ema-&gt;get(&#39;build_up_length&#39;), 8);
is($ema-&gt;get(&#39;length&#39;), 4);

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
And, we replace <tt>length</tt> and
<tt>build_up_length</tt> with a single method:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
sub get {
    return shift-&gt;{shift(@_)};
}

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
We also refactor uses of <tt>build_up_length</tt> and
<tt>length</tt> in the plotting module.  This is the
nature of continuous rennovation: constant change everywhere.  And,
that&#39;s the part that puts people off.  They might ask why the last two
changes (adding <tt>length</tt> and refactoring
<tt>get</tt>) were necessary.
</p>



<h3>Change Happens</h3>

<p>
Whether you like it or not, change happens.  You can&#39;t stop it.  If
you ignore it, your software becomes brittle, and you have more
(boring and high stress) work to do playing catch up with the change.
The proactive practices of testing and refactoring seem unnecessary
until you do hit that defect that&#39;s been copied all over the code, and
you are forced to fix it.  Not only is it difficult to find all copies
of an error, but you also have to find all places in the
code which unexpectedly depended on the behavior caused by the
defect.  Errors multiply so that&#39;s changing a single error
into N-squared errors   It gets even worse when the practice of
copy-and-pasting is copied.  That&#39;s N-cubed, and that will make a mess
of even the best starting code base.  Refactoring when you see
replication is the only way to eliminate this geometric effect.

Without tests, refactoring is no longer engineering, it&#39;s hacking.
Even the best hackers hit a wall if they can&#39;t validate a change
hasn&#39;t broken something.  They&#39;ll create ad hoc tests if necessary.
XP formalizes this process.  However, unit testing is still an art.
The only way to get good at it is by seeing more examples.
The next chapter takes a deeper
look at the unit testing in a more realistic environment.

Software Entropy
is often defined as software that "loses its original design
structure" 
(<a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/software_entropy.html">http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/software_entropy.html</a>).
Continuous design turns the concept of software entropy right side up
(and throws it right out the window) by changing the focus from the
code to what the software is supposed to do. Software entropy is
meaningless when there are tests that specify the expected behavior
for all parts of an application.  The tests eliminate the fear of
change inherent in non-test-driven software methodologies.
